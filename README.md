# Cookbook-Website
Personal Project for Learning Purposes and Practicing Front-End and Back-End Programming. With my interest in cooking and always looking up recipes online, it just led me to try making a website of my own where I will be collecting all the good recipes that I like creating and will also add some of my own to them.  

Below I will be explaining about all the process that I went through while creating this project.

Q: Name / Logo for the Website?
 - Small Kitchen, Well I just grabbed the idea from the place where I cook my food, it being a Small Kitchen.
 - It will be a blog type Cookbook, where the recipes will be in the blogs and the new/most popular ones show up at the home page.

Q: What Pages Will We Have?
 - Home Page
    - A header with logo and navigation (common thru the website)
    - A banner, which may or may not have a slideshow type images and links to recipes
    - Below that will be squares in which I will put the new recipes posted on the Website
    - Those square will definitely have images and brief description about the item.
    - Four to Six recipes under the banner depending on what style we choose and how they fit on the page.
    - At the bottom a footer with the sitemap and social links and the copyright. (common thru the website)
    - Will have a search area to lookup recipes. (common thru the website)

  - Blog

    - Two of the newest posts listed in full on the left and the three to four pinned posts with a short desc on the right
